This is actually not an engine (I'm not sure what it will become) I wasn't too sure what to call it. It's mainly me messing around with the turotials in https://learnopengl.com/ to learn more about graphics
Currently the CMakeLists only takes into account Linux because that's what I set this up on. I'll have it working on Windows at a later date
